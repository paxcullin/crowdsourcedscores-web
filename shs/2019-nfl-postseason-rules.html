                    <h3>2019 NFL Postseason Contest Rules</h3>
                    <p>The <strong>Stakehouse Sports</strong> 2020 NFL Postseason Contest will run every week of the 2019 NFL Postseason from January 4 through the final game of the NFL season on February 4, 2020.</p>
                    <p>Official Rules will be posted by 9:00 am PT on January 3.</p>
                    <!-- <p>NO PURCHASE NECESSARY. VOID WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW. THE FOLLOWING PROMOTION IS INTENDED FOR VIEWING IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ONLY (EXCLUDING PUERTO RICO, OTHER U.S. TERRITORIES AND FOREIGN TERRITORIES) AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND EVALUATED ACCORDING TO UNITED STATES LAW.</p> -->


                    <!-- <h2>Spreads</h2>
                    <p>All spreads will be locked 24 hours prior to the start of each games. The spreads will be sourced from predictionmachine.com.</p>

                    Scoring
                    Each prediction can earn a maximum of 10 points:

                    Predict the winner correctly: 2 points
                    Predict the spread winner correctly: 2 points
                    Predict the Over/Under total correctly: 2 points
                    Predict the final spread exactly right: 1 point
                    Predict the final total exactly right: 1 point
                    Predict the exact score for the home team: 1 point
                    Predict the exact score for the away team: 1 point
                    At the end of each weekend, we tally all of the points and the user(s) with the highest point total earns the weekly purse. The user(s) with the highest point total for all predictions at the end of the postseason (after the final game), earns the end-of-postseason purse.

                    Weekly Tiebreakers:

                    The user who predicted more winners correctly
                    The lower average delta from the user’s predicted spread to the actual spread across all games
                    The lower average delta from the user’s predicted totals to the actual totals across all games
                    If users are still tied after all 3 tiebreakers, the users will split the winnings.

                    End-of-Season Tiebreakers:

                    The user who predicted more winners across all postseason games correctly
                    The user who predicted more spread-winners across all postseason games correctly
                    The user who predicted more total sides across all postseason games correctly
                    Prizes:

                    Each week, $120 will be set aside and will be split up evenly across each available wager (moneyline, spread, and total). The side will be decided by the crowd, and based on the results, the pot will be increased and decreased accordingly.

                    Weekly: Half of the pot will be distributed to the user(s) who had the highest aggregate score (and won the tiebreakers, if necessary).
                    End-of-Season: The other half of each weekly pot will be set aside for the end-of-season winner, and the accumulated total will be distributed to the user who had the highest aggregate score. -->
