    <h2><a name="wagering">STAKES</a></h2>
    <h3>How does wagering work?</h3>
    <p>Wagering stakes is totally free, and it works just like betting at the sportsbooks.</p>
    <p>First, you predict the score to set the moneyline, against the spread, and the over/under. Getting a wager correct in the same way you earn points towards your prediction score.
    </p>
    <h3>Why are multiple sportsbooks listed for each wager?</h3>
    <p>Each sportsbook includes a vigorish or "vig" on each wager. A negative vig is the amount you would need to wager to net 100. So a win on a wager with a -110 vig would result in 210 stakes.<br>
    Meanwhile, a positive vig indicates how much you would net with a 100-stake wager. So a winning 100-stake wager with a +105 vig would result in 205 stakes.</p>
    <p>We give you 10000 stakes just for joining, and if you empty your bank roll, you can earn more stakes if you watch an ad or two.</p>
    <p>After each game, we calculate your return on investment by subtracting the units lost from the units won and dividing that by the units wagered.</p>
    <h3>What if I don’t want to wager any units?</h3>
    <p>You don’t have to! Just like the experts, you can stay away from a game if you don’t feel confident in a particular prediction.</p>
    <p>In fact, unlike the prediction score leaderboards, it’s actually better for you to stay away from wagering units if you’re not sure about them.</p>
    <p>HOWEVER, in order to qualify for the weekly leaderboard, we are following the super contest model and requiring 5 wagers per week. For the overall leaderboard, you have to make 85 wagers over the course of the regular season (average of 5 wagers per week.</p>
    <h3>How do the ROI leaderboards work?</h3>
    <p>The ROI leaderboards are ranked based on the user’s ROI, and the users have to make 5 wagers per week to qualify for the weekly leaderboard, and 5 wagers per week on average to qualify for the overall leaderboard.</p>
    <p>The ROI is determined by subtracting the total units lost from the total units won and dividing by the total units wagered. In the event of a tie, the tiebreakers will be (in order):</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Who won more total units</li>
        <li>Who made more wagers</li>
        <li>Who lost fewer total units</li>
    </ol>
