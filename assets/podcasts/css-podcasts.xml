    <itunes:summary>The Crowd Wisdom Sports Podcast brings you fun and unique discussions about sports predictions generated through crowd wisdom. Rather than relying on one or two experts, we believe that the crowd is wiser in the long run. Each week Paul and Chris review how the crowd performed over the weekend, identify some things that the crowd got really right (and really wrong), and talk to our best predictors to see how they make their predictions.</itunes:summary>
